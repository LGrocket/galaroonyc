		<p><span class="name">Charl&egrave;ne von Saher</span> of Grennwich, CT and New York City is the creator and founder of GalaRoo NYC, a company whose proprietary designs offer elegant special event seating solutions. </p>
		<p>Von Saher spend her early years as an elite figure skater, including competing in the 1994 Winter Olympics. She has spent the past decade reclaiming her family's extensive art collection that was lost during WWII. Von Saher is a passionate philanthropist who is active in the fine art and animal welfare arenas.</p>
		<p>After losing her clutch under the table at a black tie gala (yet again!), and seeing the painstakingly decorated table top cluttered with programs and numerous wine glasses, von Saher took to her sewing machine. The result was "GalaRoo", a pocketed seat cushion (patent-pending), with a tailored and practical design that will bring order to any special event table.</p>
		<p>Combining her dedication as an Olympic athlete, her entrepreneurial sprit, and her her years on the charity circuit, von Saher is committed and well positioned to revolutionize special event seating.</p>
		<p>And to save evening bags everywhere!</p>
